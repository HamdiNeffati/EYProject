# EYProject
### Application developed during my internship at the EY Assurance department.
This app allows my manager to view and edit their employees' missions as well as check their status. This app performs data cleaning automatically and outputs a clean and ready to use Excel sheet preserving the initial format it imported. this app was created in the goal of  decreasing time spent allocating employees and made it easier for the manager to view their employees' schedules, on top of that the manager can use the simple interface to allocate work to available employees, if they want to they could also modify pre-existing schedules, change missions and add new dates.

The app comes with an easy to use interface and error handling by providing clear messages allowing its usage by non python coders.
